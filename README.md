# 360-Degree-Panoramic-Display-System
This matlab code is a tiny part of my bachelor thesis (Vehicle 360 Degree Panoramic Display System) in 2013 for presenting what is parnormaic display system. The main code is written with C and run in DSP (TMS320DM642).

X*.txt store the position of corners extracted with corner deteciton and clustering algorithm in 1~4.jpg.

1-4.jpg are raw input image, and captured with fisheye camera installed around car.
